# Welcome to my home task repository. This project was created to demonstrate my coding skills and UI tech stack knowledge.

The application was deployed using Github Pages:
#### https://dmitrykandratsenka.github.io/github-repositories-plugin"

This project uses the following tech stack:
#### ReactJS
#### TypeScript
#### Playwright
#### Material UI
#### Webpack
#### NPM

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the `cucumber` test runner. Main framework testing frameworks are: `playwright` and `cucumberjs`

NOTE: `npm start` is required first to be running since tests do end-to-end verification

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
